# Social-Network

# Description
The purpose of this project was to create a collection of mongoose models and routes.  User, thought and reaction schema was created.  Users can be associated with one another by becoming friends with one another.  Users are also associated with thoughts which can be added.  Reactions, which are associated with thoughts can also be created.  The project enabled me to practice building models and routes with Mongoose.

# Features
* Users can be added, updated, deleted, and selected using the get all or get one routes.
* Thoughts can be added, updated, deleted, and selected using the get all or get one routes.(Thoughts are assocatiated with users)
* Users can be associated with one another by using the add friend route.
* Reactions can be associated with thoughts using the add reaction route.
* When a thought is deleted, its association with the user is also deleted.
* When a reaction is deleted its association with a thought is also deleted.
* When a user is deleted, their corresponding thoughts are also deleted.

# Technologies Used
* Node.js
* Express
